####About the Research Center

###We explore how technologies using data created by and about people are transforming society.

We are studying the many ways in which data and data processing are shaping how we work, live, create and relate in a networked, digitized world. We also design and build new tools for using data to understand human needs and behavior both inside and beyond Columbia University and the academy as a whole.

We are a diverse group of creative technologists, designers and scientists, with affiliates specializing in architecture, the humanities, social sciences, education, journalism, computer science, and engineering. By supporting interdisciplinary research partnerships and convening timely, thought-provoking events, we seek to bring multi-faceted approaches to current issues in data science.
