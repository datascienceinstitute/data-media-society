Each term, the Center for Data, Media and Society helps support interdisciplinary research projects by funding students to work on projects at the intersection of data science and other disciplines. These projects have involved everything from computationally-driven music and historical archive annotation, to supporting agricultural decision-making and inclusive fashion design. We encourage both students and faculty to get in touch to discuss existing projects, or for help in finding project partners in another field.

### Upcoming Projects

#### Just-in-time Mobile App for Adolescent Mental Health

This project is connected to a study at the Columbia University School of Social Work exaiming associations between adolescent mental health and physiological data, sociability metrics and self-reported daily stressors. The goal of this work is to use this data to inform the development of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (delivered by smart phone) to reduce mental health problems among adolescents. This project is seeking a student to develop a mobile app that can deliver these just-in-time interventions. Read more >>


### Recent Projects

#### Uni-ke

Uni-ke is an interdisciplinary project that aims to provide individuals with an economic avenue to become involved in creative entrepreneurship. With Center support, CS student Christian Cruz Godoy built a web application that allows users to create art and sell it, while on the back end connecting them with potential producers nationwide. Robust data analytics that both assist the artists and established production businesses so as to provide value to both parties. The project also provides a window into economic exclusion of the youth demographic worldwide and immigrant/refugee employment inaccessibility. 

Uni-ke is now a vibrant online brand. You can shop their products at https://www.uni-ke.com/, learn about their mission at https://www.uni-ke.com/theory and follow them on IG @uni__ke.

#### VizPol

VizPol is an app designed to provide journalists with contextual information about unfamiliar graphic symbols they may encounter during field reporting, especially during live events, protests, and rallies. By offering journalists some additional information about these symbols (or just alerting them to the fact that a symbol may have broader political connotations) the VizPol app supports more accurate, effective reporting on an increasingly complex political landscape. 

You can learn more about the VizPol project on Twitter/Medium @vizpolresearch.
