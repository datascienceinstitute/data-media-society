## Spring 2021

### Call for Research Proposals

#### Overview

The DSI Center for Data, Media and Society is pleased to announce our call for spring project proposals.  The purpose of the program is to identify promising undergraduate, masters, or graduate students to accelerate collaborative, high-impact research projects in the humanities (broadly defined).  


#### Project requirements

We encourage both faculty and students to submit project proposals. The primary requirement is that a project must ensure that there are at least **2 research mentors** - one in humanities and one in DSI/CS - that can meet weekly with the funded students. Thus, students may submit a proposal if they have identified research mentors for the project. 

Supported projects must submit a poster, a 3-5-page progress report, and a short video demo at the end of the semester outlining the following:

- A description of the specific work pursued over the course of the semester, and how it moved forward the overall research project/agenda
- Links to any outputs (e.g. papers, articles or other media, code, published interviews &c.)
- 2-3 paragraphs from each faculty mentor and student involved reflecting on the impact of the work on their own broader academic or research goals and development
- Next steps for the project

#### Project Selection and Support

Up to 4 accepted projects will be awarded funding for one student with a stipend of up to $2,500, or, at the discretion of the appropriately advising faculty, may be taken for credit. For interested faculty who have not identified a particular student they would like to support, the Center for Data, Media and Society will be soliciting applications from interested students who may be a good fit for your project. Project mentors will then be asked to select a student from those provided. A committee of center members will review the proposals and allocate these funds.

#### Application Process

Project proposals should be a maximum of 1 page, and include the following information:

1. If this is a student or faculty proposal
2. Name, title, and email of humanities faculty mentor(s)
3. Name, title, and email of DSI/computational research mentor(s)
4. Name, seniority, and email of student(s) (if student has been identified by the faculty, or this is a student proposal)
5. Whether you need help recruiting students for the project
6. Project title and description. This brief overview should emphasize the impact of the project and how participating in this program can uniquely accelerate the research.
7. If the project has previously received support from either DSI (for example, the 2020 DSI Scholars summer program) or the Center for Data, Media & Society, the application should include a paragraph describing what was achieved during the previous term(s) of support and how the work can be importantly extended by continued support. Returning projects are encouraged to apply, but ongoing funding is not guaranteed.
